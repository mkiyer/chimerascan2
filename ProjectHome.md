## Introduction ##

> Recurrent gene fusions (a.k.a. chimeras) are a prevalent class of mutations that can produce functional transcripts that contribute to cancer progression. Recent advanced in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled reliable gene fusion discovery (1-3). chimerascan is a software package that detects gene fusions in RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets.
